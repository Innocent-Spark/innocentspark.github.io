# Project Vision

We aim to create a community that balances private and shared spaces, allowing for both solitude and collaboration. Our long-term vision includes:

1. Restoring the 7 stone ruins into a combination of private homes and shared spaces
2. Developing sustainable systems for food production, energy, and water management
3. Creating spaces for creative pursuits, such as art studios, music rooms, or workshops
4. Establishing a supportive community that values sustainable living and mutual support
