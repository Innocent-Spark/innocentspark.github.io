# Introduction

We are Joseph and Dmitry, an Anglo-American team based between Austin and Berlin, with a passion for nature and sustainable living. We've recently acquired a beautiful 5.3-hectare property along the Rio Paiva in northern Portugal, and we're looking for like-minded individuals to join us in co-owning and developing this land into a sustainable community.

Inspired by projects like [Empire](https://tynan.com/empire/) and [Projekt Kamp](https://projectkamp.com/mission.html), our goal is to restore a former hamlet and create a space that fosters social connections, creativity, and sustainability, while respecting the natural environment.
