# Project Updates

## March 15, 2025

Hey folks,

Just a little update on the project.

Late last year, a topographic surveyor and I walked the boundaries of the land and uncovered the (ancient) markers laying out the borders. This will be used to update the rural land registry - BUPi. Surrounding the land on the eastern side, there is some land that is unowned. More river area is assigned to the plot than we expected.

Dmitry and I are seeking planning permission from the city council for two houses. We have commissioned an architect who has met with the city council, which has requested us to send in more details about our vision.
