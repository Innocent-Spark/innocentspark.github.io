While the property feels secluded, the nearest village is just a short drive away, offering:

- 2 well-stocked supermarkets, one with a great fish section
- 2 caf√©/bars, one more for coffee, one more for beers
- A restaurant serving traditional food
- An excellent bakery for fresh bread 

In the area, there are some excellent restaurants. [This is my favorite](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bwvkisYTNQSixVZP7).
