# Investment Opportunity

We've structured this project as a shared venture through a company that holds the property in trust. By investing, you'll become a shareholder in this company, which serves as the steward of this beautiful land.

## Financial Details

The property was acquired for €130,000, with approximately €15,000 in additional taxes and notary fees. The land includes 7 redevelopable stone buildings, which represent limited and valuable assets within the property.

Given the total investment of €145,000 and 7 redevelopable buildings, each building represents approximately €20,700 of the property's value. Therefore, the minimum investment to secure rights to redevelop one building would be around €21,000, or roughly 14.5% ownership in the company.

However, money is only one kind of investment. If you have special skills that are applicable in a rural environment, or you are up for living there full-time while amenities are being built, we can discuss other ways of getting involved.

## Beyond Financial Returns

This opportunity transcends traditional investment. As a shareholder, you'll help shape a sustainable community in one of Europe's most pristine regions, creating both environmental and social value alongside any financial returns.
